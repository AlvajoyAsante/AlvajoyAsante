As an aspiring software developer, genuinely committed to creating inclusive learning environments, empowering the tech community through mentoring, and ensuring that everyone can learn to code. I like working with technologies like Python, C++, and Java. I create tutorials for beginners to help them get more comfortable with the foundations of programming, while also getting into advanced programming topics as well on Youtube. Recognizing that  learning together is the best way to grow, I want to enable people from all backgrounds to start their tech adventure, create creative solutions, and share their knowledge and skills.
